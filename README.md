These following descriptions will summarize the details found in each folder regarding its contained project:

•	Coke – Customer Duplicates: Used the Python Pandas library and data governance techniques to discover data redundancies in customer accounts.  

•	Data Mining Forecasting Project: Used multiple Python libraries to use different forecasting techniques to predict the last five years of US alcohol consumption in a dataset and compared those techniques to the dataset’s actual values. 

•	Database Final Project: Used SQL and ERD diagrams to create a mock public bus database system for querying purposes.  

•	Econometric Causal Inference Project: Uses causal inference techniques to find the predictors of and the effect of state legalization of medical marijuana on each state’s alcohol consumption.

•	Financial Projects: A collection of financial and cost-benefit analyses via projects, work in Excel, and Tableau. This file has a “Fin_README.pdf” for more quick information.

•	Global Video Game Sales Analysis: Used Python Pandas and Matplotlib’s data visualization libraries to identify some global preferences in video games since the 80s. 

•	Hopistal Price Analysis for Capstone: In the capstone project, we compiled and cleaned hospital procedure price data to then provide a Tableau dashboard, run a regression model, and demonstrate the discrepancies of reported prices.

•	Idle Workers at Mosaic Café: Used Excel, random sampling, and statistics to do a work study for an on-campus café to make productivity insights.   

•	Operations Research Project: Used linear programming and scoring methods to help students choose internships based on job ratings, pay, and commutes.  

•	Reverse Logistics Project: Used AnyLogic modeling to simulate relationships between efficiency levels and costs in the logistical process of battery recovery.   

•	Six Sigma Applications Simulation: Used statistics and Six Sigma tools to find statistical differences in revenue strategies and deviations in performance in a simulated live performance theater.   

•	Tableau Marketing Analysis: Using Tableau, visualizations were created from Adidas sales data to make insights on consumer segmentations.
